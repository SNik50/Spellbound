Flicker - 1 Small Room

- Description: The caster spawns in a room on a ledge facing a chasm with spike traps and a Dark Altar on the other
  side of the chasm. The room is split by a wall of tinted glass going from the caster's ledge to the other side of the
  chasm. While the chasm has nothing but spike traps on the caster's side of the glass, the other side shows a parkour
  path of different stone bricks leading to the altar. The caster must navigate the invisible path to reach the altar.
  Solid stone bricks are safe to walk on, but cracked bricks are fake and will cause the caster to fall into the chasm.
